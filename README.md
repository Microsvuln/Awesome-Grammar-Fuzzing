- Building Fast Fuzzers (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07707.pdf)
    - In this paper, we describe how to build fast grammar fuzzers from the ground up, treating the problem of fuzzing from a programming language implementation perspective. Starting with a Python textbook approach, we adopt and adapt optimization techniques from functional programming and virtual machine implementation techniques together with other novel domain-specific optimizations in a step-by-step fashion. In our F1 prototype fuzzer, these improve production speed by a factor of 100--300 over the fastest grammar fuzzer Dharma. As F1 is even 5--8 times faster than a lexical random fuzzer, we can find bugs faster and test with much larger valid inputs than previously possible.   

- NAUTILUS: Fishing for Deep Bugs with Grammars (https://www.syssec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/emma/veroeffentlichungen/2018/12/17/NDSS19-Nautilus.pdf) (NDSS'19)
    - In this paper, we propose NAUTILUS, a method to efficiently fuzz programs that require highly-structured inputs by combining the use of grammars with the use of code coverage feedback. This allows us to recombine aspects of interesting inputs that were learned individually, and to dramatically increase the probability that any generated input will be accepted by the parser. We implemented a proof-of-concept fuzzer that we tested on multiple targets, including ChakraCore (the JavaScript engine of Microsoft Edge), PHP, mruby, and Lua. NAUTILUS identified multiple bugs in all of the targets: Seven in mruby, three in PHP, two in ChakraCore, and one in Lua. Reporting these bugs was awarded with a sum of 2600 USD and 6 CVEs were assigned. Our experiments show that combining context-free grammars and feedback-driven fuzzing significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) by an order of magnitude and grammar fuzzers by more than a factor of two when measuring code coverage.

- Evolutionary Grammar-Based Fuzzing (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-59762-7_8) (SSBSE â€˜20)
    - In this paper, we present EvoGFuzz, an evolutionary grammar-based fuzzing approach to optimize the probabilities to generate test inputs that may be more likely to trigger exceptional behavior. The evaluation shows the effectiveness of EvoGFuzz in detecting defects compared to probabilistic grammar-based fuzzing (baseline). Applied to ten real-world applications with common input formats (JSON, JavaScript, or CSS3), the evaluation shows that EvoGFuzz achieved a significantly larger median line coverage for all subjects by up to 48% compared to the baseline. Moreover, EvoGFuzz managed to expose 11 unique defects, from which five have not been detected by the baseline.

- Superion: Grammar-Aware Greybox Fuzzing (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01197.pdf) (ICSE'19)
    - we propose a grammar-aware coverage-based greybox fuzzing approach to fuzz programs that process structured inputs. Given the grammar (which is often publicly available) of test inputs, we introduce a grammar-aware trimming strategy to trim test inputs at the tree level using the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of parsed test inputs. Further, we introduce two grammar-aware mutation strategies (i.e., enhanced dictionary-based mutation and tree-based mutation). Specifically, tree-based mutation works via replacing subtrees using the ASTs of parsed test inputs. Equipped with grammar-awareness, our approach can carry the fuzzing exploration into width and depth.
