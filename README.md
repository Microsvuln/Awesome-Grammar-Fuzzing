- Building Fast Fuzzers (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07707.pdf)
    - In this paper, we describe how to build fast grammar fuzzers from the ground up, treating the problem of fuzzing from a programming language implementation perspective. Starting with a Python textbook approach, we adopt and adapt optimization techniques from functional programming and virtual machine implementation techniques together with other novel domain-specific optimizations in a step-by-step fashion. In our F1 prototype fuzzer, these improve production speed by a factor of 100--300 over the fastest grammar fuzzer Dharma. As F1 is even 5--8 times faster than a lexical random fuzzer, we can find bugs faster and test with much larger valid inputs than previously possible.
